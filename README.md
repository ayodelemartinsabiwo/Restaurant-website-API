Restaurant App - README

This directory contains the code for a Django restaurant app named "restaurant."

Project Structure:

The project is organized into the following directories:

admin.py: This file registers models with the Django admin site for management purposes.
forms.py: This file defines a form for booking reservations.
models.py: This file defines the data models for the restaurant app, including Menu and Booking.
urls.py: This file defines URL patterns for the app, mapping URLs to specific views.
views.py: This file contains the view functions that handle user requests and render templates.
static/: This directory contains static files such as CSS stylesheets, images, and JavaScript code.
templates/: This directory contains HTML templates for rendering the app's user interface.


Template Files:

about.html: This template displays information about the restaurant.
base.html: This is the base template for all other app templates. It includes common elements like header, footer, and navigation.
book.html: This template allows users to book a reservation.
bookings.html: This template displays a list of existing reservations.
index.html: This is the main landing page of the app.
menu_item.html: This template displays details of a specific menu item.
NOTE: Some template files used Java Scripts code lines to fetch data from the database and display data to UI for client interaction


Running the App:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python and Django installed on your system.
Project Setup: Create a virtual environment and activate it. Clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory.
Install Dependencies: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install required libraries. Or Run pipenv install to install all dependencies
Database Setup: Configure your database settings in settings.py. Run database migrations with python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate.
Run the Development Server: Start the development server with python manage.py runserver.


Additional Notes:

The views.py file utilizes Django's built-in functionalities for form handling, template rendering, data serialization, and database interaction.
The static directory stores static resources that are referenced within the templates.
The bookings view with the @csrf_exempt decorator is used for handling booking submissions via AJAX requests.


Further Development:

This is a basic restaurant app. You can extend its functionality by:

Adding more models for managing different aspects of the restaurant.
Implementing user authentication and authorization.
Integrating a payment gateway for online reservations.
Creating a more comprehensive menu management system.
I hope this README provides a clear understanding of the restaurant app's structure and functionalities.
Feel free to modify and expand upon this codebase for your specific requirements.
